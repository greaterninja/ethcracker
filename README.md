# Usage 

    ethcracker -pk ~/test/pk.txt -t ~/test/templates.txt

    -pk path to the private key file
    -t  path to the template file
    -l  path to the file with all the possible variants (every line has one variant) If -l is specified, -t is ignored
    -presale  for cracking prelase JSON file
    -threads Number of threads
    -v Verbosity ( 0, 1, 2 )
    -start_from Skip first N combinations
    -keep_order Keep the order of the lines ( no permutations )
    -re Report every N-th combination
    -dump path Just dump all the variants into text file
    

# Template file format

Every line contains the possible variants of the substring. For example file:

    a1 a2 a3
    b

will generate all those combinations

    a1
    a2
    a3
    b
    a1b
    ba1
    a2b
    ba2
    a3b
    ba3

Note: you can use \s to specify white space. ( "a\sb" means "a b" )


# Template line flags 

You can also specify some keys for every line. 

    ~a always use some value from this string
    ~c Try both: capitalized and not-capitalazed versions of all words. 
    
For example the template file

    a 
    ~ac test

will generate all those combinations

    test
    Test
    atest
    aTest
    testa
    Testa
